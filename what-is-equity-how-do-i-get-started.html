                                    Most of you must have heard stories about how certain stocks have multiplied
                                    manifold over the last 10 or 15 years. Many investors talk about how they have made
                                    fortunes in the equity markets. Before we jump to conclusions, it is important to
                                    understand that equity investment is riskier and more volatile when compared to
                                    traditional forms of investments like fixed deposits or bonds. However, people
                                    prefer them because they have the potential for higher returns. The Sensex has grown
                                    phenomenally in the last 40 to 50 years and those who stuck on made profits. Equity
                                    investing calls for planning, analysis and the ability to stay put in the long term.
                                    What is equity?</p>
                                <p> Equity is also referred to as shares and stocks of a company. Therefore, when you
                                    buy equity, you become part owners of the company. In broad terms, equity refers to
                                    the amount of money that would be returned to a company’s shareholders should all
                                    the assets be liquidated and all the company’s debt were paid off. These shares are
                                    traded on the stock market. So, when you own equity in a company, you receive
                                    returns in the form of dividends that the company distributes and you also get
                                    capital gains when the stock price goes above the purchase price. In short, when you
                                    own equity, you have ownership. The owner or the equity shareholder receives high
                                    returns along with a high risk as well.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> Key aspects of equity trading</p>
                                <p> Before we understand how to invest in equity, let us understand certain terms
                                    related to equity.</p>
                                <p> 1. Shares: A share is a unit of ownership in a specific company. For instance, you
                                    could say that you won 10 shares in a company X.</p>
                                <p> 2. Stocks: Stocks is a term that is used to refer to portions of ownership in
                                    multiple companies. For example, you could say that you own stocks in Company X and
                                    Company Y.</p>
                                <p> 3. Equity: Equity is a term used when you want to denote the total ownership stake
                                    in a company. For example, if a company has 10,000 shares, and you owned 1000 of
                                    them, you could say that you own 10% equity stake in that company.</p>
                                <p> 4. Stock market: An exchange mechanism that helps investors buy and sell shares,
                                    bonds, and securities in publicly traded companies. In this platform, buyers and
                                    sellers come together to trade financial tools during specific hours of the business
                                    day. They have to adhere to guidelines laid out by the Securities and exchange Board
                                    of India (SEBI). Trades are done electronically.</p>
                                <p> 5. Broker: Individual investors who typically execute equity trades through
                                    brokerage firms. These firms act as intermediaries and facilitate the buying and
                                    selling of stocks on behalf of their clients.</p>
                                <p> 6. Indices: Indices refer to a standardized way to track the performance of a group
                                    of assets or stocks. Indices such as Nifty 50 and Sensex, are benchmarks that
                                    represent the overall performance of the stock market. The indices are composed of a
                                    basket of stocks and serve as indicators of market trends.</p>
                                <p> 7. Regulatory bodies: SEBI is the regulatory body for securities and commodities
                                    market in India. SEBI ensures fair practices and investor protection in the capital
                                    markets.</p>
                                <p> 8. Investor types: There are different types of investors in the equity market like
                                    retail investors (individuals), institutional investors (mutual funds, banks and
                                    insurance companies) and foreign institutional investors (FIIs).</p>
                                <p> 9. Settlement process: The settlement process involves the transfer of shares and
                                    funds between buyers and sellers. In India, the settlement cycle is normally T + 1,
                                    which means the transaction settles one business day after the trade date.</p>
                                <p> 10. Risk and reward: Every equity investor knows that equity trading involves risk.
                                    The prices can be influenced by various factors such as company performance,
                                    economic conditions, global events, and market sentiment. Investors aim to profit
                                    from price fluctuations and dividend income.</p>
                                How to invest in equity?</p>
                                <p> To begin trading in equity, you need to follow the following steps:</p>

                                    and a trading account with a broker firm to invest in the stock market. A trading
                                    account is for transactions and demat account is for holding the shares. It is
                                    mandatory to have both these accounts. Ideally, take advise from a financial advisor
                                    who can guide you on what to buy and purchase the funds for you. The other option is
                                    to purchase the equity funds from a fund house directly.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> Step 2: Open a Demat and trading account</p>
                                <p> Simple steps can be followed to open a Demat account:</p>

                                <p> • A payment gateway</p>
                                <p> • You could use RTGS/ NEFT/ IMPS</p>
                                <p> • You could also use a cheque or DD to transfer funds</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> Step 4: View stock details and start trading</p>
                                <p> Log in and explore the share market on your Demat and trading account. Analyse stock
                                    prices, check patterns, and observe price movements using charts and other tools.
                                    Select the stocks that you want to trade and place your order.</p>
                                Key benefits of investing in equity shares</p>
                                <p> • Equities are a reliable asset and create wealth in the long-term.</p>
                                <p> • When you invest in a portfolio of about 8 to 10 stocks, you can diversify the
                                    risk. You can also consider investing in a equity fund. This is a mutual fund that
                                    invests in equities.</p>
                                <p> • You can monitor your portfolio value live on your trading platform 24*7.</p>
                                <p> • The tax component on equities are lower than that of fixed deposits or bonds.</p>
                                Risks of investing in the stock market</p>
                                <p> Investing in the stock market can be volatile and unpredictable in the short term
                                    and more consistent in the long term. Ensure that you buy quality stocks or rely on
                                    equity mutual funds. It is important to be patient with equities and not expect
                                    miracles to happen. Stock markets are affected by various things like global events
                                    or market conditions which are out of your control. Therefore ensure that you have a
                                    diverse portfolio.</p>
                                <p class="text-g">Conclusion</p>
                                <p> Equity trading is an attractive investment. Investors must approach the market with
                                    a clear understanding of the risks involved, their own risk tolerance, investment
                                    goals and a well thought out strategy. It is important to stay informed of market
                                    trends and company performance and make prudent investment decisions.
