                                    Integrated financial planning is not just a new management idea. It is also not just
                                    another method or tool to make sense of your organization’s financials. It is sound
                                    business strategy.</p>
                                <p> With integrated financial planning you secure the financial future of your company
                                    by strategically tying it up with your organizational vision. This represents a
                                    significant shift in the way you approach financial planning. It used to be a very
                                    closed, departmental affair with essentially the finance team alone deciding what
                                    every other department must be doing to achieve business results. This included
                                    budgeting and sanctioning funds for each department by the finance team. But with
                                    integrated finance planning, the approach has turned collaborative. Every department
                                    is consulted, every department shares data and every department is engaged with the
                                    overall business plan of the company. Nobody is left out.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> The old order</p>
                                <p> Typically, the finance team gathers data – after pushing, jostling and pleading –
                                    from every other department. Some of that data is incomplete or even erroneous at
                                    times. Then the finance team spends several long hours estimating the outlook for
                                    the business and in building the business plan. When this plan is finally shared
                                    with the other departments there is no buy-in from anyone. In fact, there is a lot
                                    of confusion and pushback. From operations to sales to marketing to HR to purchase
                                    to IT, no one is willing to believe that the revenue and earnings projections are
                                    achievable. So, basically, the company just stumbles on, into yet another business
                                    year.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> The key benefit of integrated financial planning</p>
                                <p> It is a definitive game changer. When the various departments collaborate with the
                                    finance team to develop the next year’s business plan, two things are certain:</p>
                                <p> 1. There are no data siloes. People fill information and data gaps to make sure that
                                    the data they share integrates to complete the whole, big picture for the company.
                                </p>
                                <p> 2. There is ownership of the business plan for each department because the plan has
                                    been contributed to by each of them. Basically, collaboration results in shared
                                    ownership.</p>
                                <p> Importantly, the business plan looks real to every department. Because they have
                                    co-created it. They know that they have committed to a financial goal. And they know
                                    they have to achieve it. Unless there are any unforeseen market-related or other
                                    circumstances, no department has the option of not delivering on the numbers that
                                    they have promised.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> Truly integrated</p>
                                <p> The emphasis is on the word integrated in this financial planning approach. It
                                    involves integration at three levels in the company:</p>
                                <p> • Through software: This means the data being used for financial planning integrates
                                    with the software of the enterprise. This leads to data accuracy and offer seamless
                                    access to all important function heads and leaders across the company.</p>
                                <p> • Through collaboration among leaders: When the leadership in a company is engaged
                                    closely with business planning, there is greater collaboration and therefore greater
                                    ownership. This enhances the chances of consistent high performance.</p>
                                <p> • Through offering continuous improvements: When everyone is involved with
                                    developing and reviewing the business plan, then quarterly and mid-year reviews
                                    allow for continuous improvements seamlessly.</p>
                                <p> In other words, integrated financial planning fully pan-organizational data using
                                    the enterprise’s software, it brings the leadership together to build and co-own the
                                    business plan and allows for reviews and improvements on a continuous basis.
                                    How to practice integrated financial planning?</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> At a software level</p>
                                <p> You must begin with integration at a software level. Accurate financial data is key
                                    to building a powerful and efficient business plan. The IT team has to lead this
                                    part of the process. They must invest time collecting, verifying and cleaning up all
                                    the data from all the departments. The data sets that emerge from this exercise must
                                    then be one that the enterprise’s software will crunch and deploy in the business
                                    plan.</p>
                                <p> The focus is to make your organization’s financial planning simpler and error-free.
                                    If the company is using different software platforms, the IT team must look for a
                                    viable software solution that helps integrate these diverse platforms and all the
                                    associated data that they hold.</p>
                                <p> The final test of the success of this exercise is when all key department leaders
                                    and function heads can seamlessly access data, and can certify that the data is
                                    genuinely free of any error.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> At a leadership level</p>
                                <p> Due to the way organizations have typically evolved over time, department heads
                                    function in silos. They protect their teams and their prefer to not allow too much
                                    access to their departments from the rest of the organization.</p>
                                <p> For integrated financial planning to be successful, this siloed approach must
                                    change.</p>
                                <p> Start by inviting department heads to share what their business goals for the year
                                    are. Which is, what are they planning to achieve? How much money and resources are
                                    they planning to spend to achieve these goals? And ask them to justify how this
                                    expenditure will contribute to the organization’s revenues and profits.</p>
                                <p> The finance team may then use all this information to build a plan that may be sent
                                    back to the department heads for their inputs and sign-offs. Once there is a
                                    complete buy-in, the business plan is ready for launch.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> At an ongoing improvement level</p>
                                <p> This is the most important aspect of integrated financial planning. Just as in
                                    sports, when a team’s performance needs to be reviewed and improved in the middle of
                                    a game, so it is in business too. The integrated financial planning approach allows
                                    for dynamic, real-time reviews and continuous improvements. This makes the
                                    organization agile and nimble-footed. An organization that can adapt to market
                                    developments quickly always has an advantage over its competitors.</p>
                                <p> These reviews may essentially focus on the following aspects:</p>
                                <p> • Why were the numbers achieved?</p>
                                <p> • Why were they not achieved?</p>
                                <p> • What were the external (market) factors responsible for our performance?</p>
                                <p> • What were the internal factors responsible for our performance?</p>
                                <p> • How to maximize and sustain what worked for us and minimize and eliminate what
                                    isn’t working for us?</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> Conclusion</p>
                                <p> Integrated financial planning is a very powerful idea. No organization can afford to
                                    ignore it. The value created with this approach is immense:</p>
                                <p> • An accurate business plan that is co-created and co-owned by your entire
                                    leadership team.</p>
                                <p> • A practical, authentic budget that can be counted to reliably deliver high
                                <p class="text-g"> performance.</p>
                                <p> • When team members collaborate to create a plan, they know what is expected of them
                                    to make that plan successful.
