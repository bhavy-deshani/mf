                                    Almost all health insurance plans appear to be complex at first glance. Insurance
                                    companies may make tall promises. Not all of them may be untrue too. But just the
                                    way a policy document reads can be very overwhelming for the customer. The jargon
                                    and the amount of fine print that has to be gone through and understood can put you
                                    off. Also, invariably, when a claim is being made, the company may bring up legalese
                                    to disallow the claim, in full or in part. They may draw the customer’s attention to
                                    several of the terminologies that were used in the policy contract; this is stuff
                                    that the customer had actually signed up for.</p>
                                    <p> Here's a simple, practical guide to help you understand the jargon and terminologies
                                    that are prevalent in the health insurance industry.</p>
                                    <p>  Premium: This is the amount that you would pay the health insurance company when
                                    purchasing your policy. This amount is dependant on the sum insured, the features of
                                    the policy, the age of the person insured and some other factors. A health insurance
                                    premium may be available for payment on a monthly, quarterly half-yearly or annual
                                    basis.</p>
                                    <p>  Sum insured: This is the amount that is covered by the health insurance policy. The
                                    insurance company is liable to pay this amount favoring the person insured as per
                                    the terms of the policy.</p>
                                    <p> Waiting period: Almost all health insurance companies insist on a waiting period to
                                    be completed before the policy can be used. This waiting period may not be
                                    applicable for emergencies but elective surgeries and treatments will not be allowed
                                    during this period. The waiting period may vary based on the company issuing the
                                    policy, the policy itself and the coverage benefits.</p>
                                    <p>  Deductible: A deductible is a fixed amount that is payable by you at the time of
                                    A policy that has a deductible amount payable by the customer may come at a lower
                                    premium. So customers often choose such a policy. But in some cases the customers
                                    buy the policy unaware that it has a deductible clause. This causes confusing at the
                                    time of processing a claim. It is important for customers to therefore know upfront
                                    if their policy has a deductible clause or not.</p>
                                    <p> Co-payment: The co-pay or co-payment clause in a health insurance policy refers to a
                                    percentage of the claim that the insured person (the customer) has to pay when a
                                    claim is being settled. This means if a claim for Rs.100 is being made, a percentage
                                    of that will be co-paid by the customer and the balance amount alone will be settled
                                    by the insurance company. This clause too must be read and clarified by the customer
                                    before buying the health insurance policy.</p>
                                    <p> Add-on covers/riders: An add-on cover is an optional health insurance cover that
                                    customers can choose. This benefit will cover an additional illness that may show up
                                    as an emergency. An add-on cover may increase the premium value but protects the
                                    insured person against higher medical costs.</p>
                                    <p> Automatic restoration: This is a benefit that health insurance companies offer. When
                                    a customer exhausts the value of the sum insured due to hospitalization, this amount
                                    is topped up by the company when the need for the next round of hospitalization
                                    arises. This benefit too comes at a higher premium.</p>
                                    <p> Co-morbidities/pre-existing diseases: Patients with diabetes, hypertension, kidney
                                    ailments, cardiac conditions and such other health issues are considered to be
                                    carrying high risk factors according to insurance companies. Such patients are
                                    offered insurance plans with a higher premium.</p>
                                    <p> Critical illnesses: Any life-threatening ailment falls under this category. This
                                    category is covered by separate health insurance plans. Or customers may opt for
                                    add-ons to cover the treatment costs for such ailments.</p>
                                    <p> No-claim bonus: When customers own a policy but do not make a claim during the
                                    policy year they become eligible for a no-claim bonus. This is usually an amount
                                    that is equivalent to up to 100% the sum insured. This bonus may vary based on
                                    policy plans and insurance companies.</p>
                                    <p> Network hospitals: Health insurance companies work with a wide network of hospitals.
                                    Customers of an insurance company may choose to visit a hospital that is within the
                                    company’s network to get the best benefits of their policies. Almost all hospitals
                                    in an insurer’s network offer cashless services to patients. This means that the
                                    insurer will settle the patient’s bills directly with the hospital.</p>
                                    <p> Cashless claims: This is a policy benefit feature. Most health insurance policy
                                    today offer this benefit. This means that the insurer will settle the patient’s
                                    bills directly with the hospital in the insurer’s network.</p>
                                    <p> Exclusions: These are the terms of the policy under which a health insurance claim
                                    can be rejected by the company. These terms are explicitly mentioned in the policy
                                    document.</p>
                                    <p> Inclusions: These are coverage benefits that are included in the policy. The
                                    inclusions may include ambulance charges, surgery costs, rooms bills at hospitals
                                    and other treatment-related expenses. This list is also available in the policy
                                    document.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g"> The bottom line</p>
                                    <p> Read the policy document carefully to understand what is covered and what is not.
                                    Review, clarify, understand and then sign up for your health insurance policy.
