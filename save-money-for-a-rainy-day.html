                                    Life is unpredictable. You may never know what will happen next. But be sure that
                                    something unexpected always shows up in life. You may get a pink slip, there may be
                                    a medical emergency in the family, an accident can pin you down for months or a
                                    natural calamity can hit your town and ravage your house.</p>
                                <p>The truth is that no one can tell you exactly what’s going to you. But you can
                                    surely plan well and prepare yourself financially so that you are better placed to
                                    deal with any situation. Money cannot always solve all problems. But having access
                                    to funds when you need them the most can help you in an emergency situation.</p>
                                <p class="text-g">Your personal rainy day fund</p>
                                <p>A rainy day fund is an emergency fund that you set up with some foresight and lots
                                    of self-control. This is a difficult decision to get started with in the first
                                    place. Because your monthly cash flows are usually stretched. Adding a rainy day
                                    fund to your payouts can be stressful. So you may keep postponing that decision. But
                                    please don’t delay setting up this fund more than you already have.</p>
                                <p> Set it up now. Keep saving in it monthly. Almost as if you are paying out an equated
                                    monthly instalment to deal with a home loan. And don’t ever draw from this fund to
                                    cover holiday expenses or to splurge on birthday or anniversary gifts. This is why
                                    we say that this fund requires both foresight and self-control. You need the
                                    foresight to set it up. And the self-control to keep it paid month on month,
                                    systematically, without ever drawing from it for any non-emergency expense. No,
                                    don’t even draw from it to pay for your child’s college admissions or to buy a new
                                    car. They are clearly not emergency expenses.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> What is an emergency expense?</p>
                                <p> Only these count as emergency expenses: Dealing with a grave healthcare situation or
                                    a sudden job loss or a rebuilding requirement after natural disaster has devasted
                                    your property or something similar. It must be classified as sudden, grave and close
                                    to a life-and-death situation.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> How much to save monthly?</p>
                                <p>The best way to get your rainy day fund started is to look at your monthly budget.
                                    At first level, target setting up the fund to cover six months of your monthly
                                    family/home operating costs. Arrive at a reasonable amount that you can save
                                    monthly. And compute how many months it would take you to have saved the equivalent
                                    of six months. Get started. Be diligent, be focused and be unrelenting in not giving
                                    up the effort. When you do eventually reach your target of covering six months of
                                    operating expenses, extend the target to cover one year’s operating expenses. Keep
                                    going this way.</p>
                                The first few months may be difficult. But keep doing this in disciplined manner.
                                And soon it will turn into a very good habit.</p>
                                <p class="text-g">Setting up the physical account</p>
                                <p>Open a new account in a bank that offers you a reasonable interest rate on savings.
                                    Make this account your rainy day fund account. The principle you must follow is that
                                    money can go in as planned, but money may not be taken out unless there is an
                                    emergency. Now, watch this fund grow. As it grows, it will earn an interest as well.
                                    Watching the fund grow will boost your morale and confidence. You will feel very
                                    accomplished financially. Take care to ensure that your bank does not restrict
                                    withdrawals by imposing penalties on drawings. Joining such a financial scheme will
                                    defeat the purpose of the fund. Basically, it must be available immediately in the
                                    case of an emergency. So please also make sure that the ATM card for this account is
                                    active and that you have set up internet and mobile banking facilities for this
                                    account.</p>
                                <p>Some financial advisors may recommend that you also set up additional emergency
                                    funds that can fetch you a higher rate of interest. This may involve investing in a
                                    fixed deposit account in a bank or in a liquid mutual fund. You may consider these
                                    options. But know that unlocking these funds may involve time lags that may not help
                                    you when you need the money urgently. Therefore, as a primary source of emergency
                                    funds, have your funds in a bank account that allows easy and quick access. Once you
                                    have achieved your target amount in this account, save some cash at home. Only then
                                    consider setting up an additional fixed deposit or investing in a liquid mutual
                                    fund.</p>
                                <p class="text-g">Using and replenishing</p>
                                <p>This is a rainy-day fund. And there will be several rainy days that you will
                                    encounter in life. So, whenever you draw from this account, go back to immediately
                                    plan on replenishing it. The plan must necessarily have the same discipline with
                                    which you set up the fund in the first place. You must remit a monthly amount to the
                                    fund for several months to top up the account.
                                    Also, please note that you may draw from the fund only in the case of an emergency.
                                    Never draw from it otherwise.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> Summary</p>
                                <p> A rainy-day fund is often difficult to get started with. But the difficulty has more
                                    to do with practicing a strict financial discipline than with intent or the process
                                    of setting up a physical account. But once you set off on this journey, you will
                                    feel very accomplished and confident. The key is to sustain the operating plan and
                                    the financial discipline all through life. Because emergencies can strike at any
                                    time.
