                                    <p>Pre-planned: When planning for a car, a down payment on a house, jewelry -
                                        saving gives you the liberty of pre-calculating the duration it takes to reach
                                        your goal.</p>
                                    <p>Available Cash: Expenses no longer depend on income. Ready cash is available for
                                        any unforeseen expenses.</p>
                                    <p>Interest Gains: Several banks have interest-bearing savings accounts that provide
                                        small amounts of interest for the money in your savings account.</p>

                                    <p>Grow Your Money: Investment is a long-term plan. Investing methods such as stocks
                                        or bonds offer a higher rate of return on money, allowing you to create and grow
                                        wealth.</p>
                                    <p>Tax Advantages: Investment vehicles charge low tax on profit and gains. ELSS is
                                        one investment method with zero applicable tax on investment returns.</p>
                                    <p>Financial Flexibility: When money is invested in liquid assets, there exists
                                        financial flexibility to buy or sell them during an emergency.</p>
