                                    Every human being wants the very best for their family. The safety and security of
                                    the family forms the primary moving force in anyone’s life. Financial stability and
                                    safety ensure a secure environment, giving the family the best atmosphere to be
                                    nurtured in and grow in a healthy manner.</p>
                                    <p>  However, life is turbulent and it is not possible to know from where the next curve
                                    ball will hit you. You could have a health setback in the family or a sudden crisis
                                    like having to care for an ailing parent or maybe an accident. In any situation
                                    where a crisis erupts, the first thing that comes into the picture is your financial
                                    position and ability to handle the crisis efficiently. Of course it is also
                                    important to be strong and address the issue on hand with a calm frame of mind.
                                    However, being financially prepared is a huge advantage and can help deal with
                                    problems in a more confident manner.</p>
                                    <p>  Planning finances should be a family priority. It is important to involve your
                                    spouse. Consider if you are a sole bread winner, or a family with double income.
                                    Plan and make wise investments. See where you can save and how you can maintain the
                                    current lifestyle that you have if something happens to one of the spouses. Both
                                    spouses must be involved in financial decisions to ensure that if there is a crisis,
                                    both know how to access the funds to deal with a situation on hand.</p>
                                    <p>  There are various things that you can do to plan your finances and secure the future
                                    of your family. Let us understand the steps and where you must begin.</p>
                                  <p class="text-g">  1. Planning your finances well</p>
                                    <p>   Life is itself unpredictable. Therefore, despite being well-planned, you may face a
                                    financial setback. As a first step, it is important to learn to manage your finances
                                    well. To begin with, start by setting a financial goal. Grab a piece of paper and
                                    start planning. Answer the following questions:</p>
                                    <p>   • Where do you see yourself/ your family in 5, 10 or 15 years?</p>
                                    <p>  • What is your daily lifestyle? What do you want it to look like in the future?</p>
                                    <p>  • What are the assets that you wish to acquire/ build?</p>
                                    <p>  • When do you want to retire? How would you want to plan your retirement?</p>
                                    <p>  • How do expect your career to grow in 5, 10 and 15 years’ time?</p>
                                    <p> • What goals to do you have for your children?</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">  2. Get organized</p>
                                    <p>  Once the visioning and goal setting is done, get down to work. Things that you can
                                    start doing immediately:</p>
                                    <p>  • Make a list and review the financial accounts you have very carefully. Savings
                                    accounts, salary accounts, credit cards and so on. Keep a track of your balances in
                                    a spreadsheet. Store the passwords carefully in a password wallet.</p>
                                    <p>  • Make a list of all your debts, small and large and the interest rates that you are
                                    paying.</p>
                                    <p>   • Comb through your bank statements and credit card statements. Create an itemized
                                    monthly budget and optimize your money for higher savings.</p>
                                    3. Pay down your debts</p>
                                    <p>   Bad debt has an ability to hold your future finances down powerfully. So, look
                                    through your debts whether it is a student loan, credit card, or car loan. Paying
                                    off the debt as soon as possible should be a priority. Make every effort to cut down
                                    expenses and pay off the debt. Many people pay the minimum amount every month and
                                    push the ball to later. This is the worst thing you can do.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">  4. Invest in an insurance plan</p>
                                    <p>   Insurance plans give a lot of comfort especially at times when something happens all
                                    of a sudden. Life is uncertain and it is important to provide cushions that could be
                                    useful in the time of a crisis.</p>
                                    <p>  There are various insurance products available in the market that you could choose
                                    from. Health insurance is critical for every family. A sudden health setback or a
                                    surprise surgery could disrupt your finances suddenly. This is where health
                                    insurance provides the comfort and cover that could help immensely. You could Also
                                    consider a long-term disability insurance. This comes in handy when you have a
                                    serious illness or injury that prevents you from working for a long period of time
                                    like a couple of years. How will you survive without an income? A long-term
                                    disability plan ensures that you get paid. The other insurance that one must
                                    consider seriously is life insurance. You can take it for both you and your spouse
                                    so that should something happen to either of you, the family is compensated. Ideally
                                    it is good to take ten times of your annual income as the amount to be insured.</p>

                                    <p class="text-g">   5. Invest in quality education for children</p>

                                    <p>   Your children’s education must be a top priority when you are doing your financial
                                    planning. Enabling your children with the best education possible is the best gift
                                    you can give them. Invest in tuition classes, reference books, and online learning
                                    modules that will help your children perform better. It is also important to educate
                                    your children about financial management. The earlier they learn to earn and save,
                                    the better they can be prepared to become responsible adults themselves. Get them
                                    started young with the habit of saving.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">  6. Plan for your estate</p>
                                    <p>   Anyone and everyone must have a plan for their estate irrespective of its size. This
                                    must include a will, testament, and a power of attorney. A will is the best way to
                                    safeguard your family’s future in the years to come. If you die without making a
                                    will, your money, property and possessions will be allocated according to law which
                                    not be according to your wishes. In your will, you can make an inventory of your
                                    financial assets such as bank accounts, and life insurance policies so that the
                                    executors of your will know where to find these after you have passed away.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">  7. Research on tax savings</p>
                                    <p>   Take assistance from a financial planning advisor and examine ways in which you can
                                    save on tax payments. There are various investment options that can be helpful.
                                    Financial advisors can also help with ideas to boost financial security. Using
                                    professional help is important to achieve your financial goals.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">  8. Keep your documents safe</p>
                                    <p>  It is very important to keep all financial documents of account details and
                                    insurance policies in a safe place where your family can easily access them. You
                                    could choose a safe place at home or even a safe deposit locker to store these.
                                    Ensure that you keep your family informed of where you have stored them. These days
                                    there are various options to store them on cloud as well. Ensure that your family
                                    has the passwords in order to access them.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">  Summary</p>
                                    <p>  There is no formula for building and sustaining wealth. Everyone has to work on it
                                    themselves and do what works at an individual level. The situations and
                                    circumstances that each individual goes through dictates their path. So do your
                                    research and ensure that you plan and execute things as well as you can.
