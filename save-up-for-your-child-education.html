                                    Among the top stressors for parents in India today is the rising cost of educating
                                    their children. Public educational institutions lack quality of teaching and
                                    infrastructure. While private educational institutions offer quality on both fronts,
                                    they are very expensive. Yet, as a recent study of parents in India found, 73% of
                                    the parents polled preferred to send their children to a private institution.</p>
                                <p> The cost of educating children is not just limited to sending them to a premium
                                    school. Additionally, parents must plan to spend on extra academic coaching classes,
                                    sports and arts classes, travel for experiential learning and other educational
                                    accessories and gadgets. On an average, parents end up investing between Rs.20 lakh
                                    and Rs.30 lakh on a single child to get them through primary, middle and high
                                    school.</p>
                                <p> Even as these costs look big, schools are announcing a hike in their annual fees.
                                    One survey puts the increase at between 30% and 60%. Transport operators too have
                                    increased their charges. And the costs of books, stationery and other school-related
                                    accessories have also gone up.</p>
                                <p> So do parents cope with these rising costs? How do they plan to invest smartly so
                                    that the education of their children is secure – and the costs can be met?
                                    Parents must take a hard look at securing the education of their children. They need
                                    to plan financially on this front. There are three areas of focus.</p>
                                <p class="text-g">Focus area 1</p>
                                <p> Choosing sound investments and investing right is the first step. These sound
                                    investments are those that are insulated from the impact of inflation and yet
                                    provide good returns. Equity-based mutual funds are a good option to consider. They
                                    are managed by professionals, they have the risk spread across wide-ranging assets
                                    and the fund managers often diversify. So, these investments are reasonably safe.
                                    Systematic investments plans, or SIPs, offered by mutual funds allow parents to
                                    invest smaller sums monthly. Over time, these investments grow into a large corpus
                                    that is available to parents to fund the higher education needs of their children.
                                    In addition to mutual funds, there are public, government-approved investment
                                    options too available.</p>

                                <p class="text-g"> Focus area 2</p>
                                <p> The second way to invest in education for children is to take education loans. This
                                    step may be taken if the investments made are insufficient. But choosing the right
                                    loan is important. Most education loans come with tax benefits. The interest amount
                                    paid on the loan can be claimed as a deduction against income tax. Again, parents
                                    must plan well and understand what the impact of a long-term borrowing like an
                                    education loan is. Some loans come for a tenure of around eight years. So careful
                                    thought and consideration must go into choosing to go for such loans.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> Focus area 3</p>
                                <p> Parents must look for grants and scholarships that are available for the fields of
                                    study and areas of interest that their children have chosen. Diligent research on
                                    the internet can point parents to these funding opportunities. And if the child is
                                    meeting all eligibility criteria, these grants and scholarship can be secured
                                    seamlessly. While such funding may not bridge the entire cost of education, it will
                                    help lessen the financial pressure on parents to a significant extent.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> Think ahead with an open mind</p>
                                <p> Most parents tend to worry about the rising costs and whether they will at all be
                                    able to fund the education of their children. Worrying does not help anyone. Parents
                                    must instead keep an open mind and think of the journey ahead practically.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> Here are some tips:</p>
                                <p> 1. Do not imagine that your child should do this professional course or that even
                                    when they are still in primary or middle school. As children grow, their interests
                                    change. Their skills also develop. So don’t plan to make your child a doctor or an
                                    engineer or a lawyer or a cricketer or a musician or a filmmaker. Not when they are
                                    still in school.</p>
                                <p> 2. Instead invest a certain sum every month in a fund for your child’s future
                                    education. As the child grows, the fund will grow too. Do not touch this fund for
                                    any other purpose. Whatever be the emergency do not draw from this fund. When the
                                    child goes to high school and begins to show an aptitude for a particular field of
                                    study, you may unlock this fund and invest the amount on their education.</p>
                                <p> 3. You may actively solicit the support of your extended family if they plan to gift
                                    you child more toys and gadgets than what they have currently. You may advise them
                                    to invest in the fund. This includes grandparents, uncles and aunts. And close
                                    friends of the family.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> Conclusion</p>
                                <p> Parenting is a great opportunity to raise a talented, responsible and caring human
                                    being. Do not waste this opportunity worrying about your child. Do not also limit
                                    your child’s interests and talent by imagining that you cannot provide for them
                                    financially.</p>
                                <p> With some discipline and focus, you can plan early and plan well.
