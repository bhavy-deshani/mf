                <p>National Pension System in India (NPS) is an initiative by the Pension Fund Regulatory and
                    Development Authority (PFRDA) to develop retirement savings amongst the citizens of India. It is a
                    voluntary, contribution scheme / Plan which allows an individual to contribute during his working
                    life, build a corpus and enjoy regular income in the form of pension and lumpsum withdrawal post
                    retirement. Now Corporate Entities can also contribute to their employees pension account under "NPS
                    - Corporate Sector Model". NPS is the best national pension plan in India.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Greater the value of investment made, longer the term over which the fund accumulates and the lower
                    the charges deducted, the larger would be the eventual benefit of the accumulated pension wealth.
                    You can also contribute to your fund online.
