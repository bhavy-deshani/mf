                                    If you are a lazy investor and do not have patience to look through your equity
                                    portfolio often, then “Coffee Can investing” is for you! Essentially, coffee can
                                    investing is a low-risk way to build enormous wealth. In short, you purchase shares
                                    of outstanding companies and hold on to them for a long period of time, say 10
                                    years, without actively buying or selling them. Essentially, you are putting your
                                    money in a “coffee can” and forgetting about it while trusting that these strong
                                    companies will grow over time. Coffee can investing is for people who do not have
                                    the time or expertise to monitor their investment portfolio closely. It is a “buy
                                    and forget” approach to investing in shares.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">    Story behind the coffee can</p>
                                    <p>In old west America, people used coffee cans to store many things. They used to
                                    store valuables and important things in them and hide them under a mattress or
                                    someplace where no one could find them. This system was prevalent before the banking
                                    system was formed.</p>
                                    <p>   The old story behind the term goes thus: In 1960, there was a fund manager called
                                    Robert Kirby. He had a client whose husband bought shares of $5000 each of the
                                    company Xerox on his recommendation but never sold those shares. After he died,
                                    Kirby discovered that by holding on to the shares, he had created enormous wealth.
                                    His investments were worth more than $8,00,000 at the current date. This led Kirby
                                    to coin the term “Coffee Can investing”.</p>
                                    <p>  In India, Sourabh Mukherjee wrote a book titled “Coffee Can Investing” and
                                    introduced the term and made it popular in India. The book was co-authored with
                                    Rakshit Rajan and Pranab Uniyal. On a lighter note, Indian mothers have been storing
                                    money in grocery boxes or jars/ vessels and using them later to buy things or in
                                    investments.</p>
                                    <p>   Although the concept sounds simple, it is very difficult to implement in reality. It
                                    is extremely difficult to see the volatility in the market and still hold on to
                                    stocks for over 10 years.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">    Coffee can investing criteria</p>
                                    <p>   Ideally for coffee can investing, you must choose fundamentally strong companies
                                    with an excellent competitive edge in the market. When building a coffee can
                                    portfolio, you look for stock quality, which signifies a strong company. There are
                                    some specifics that could guide you to choose a stock for coffee can investing:</p>
                                    <p>  • The company should have been in existence for at least 10 years</p>
                                    <p>  • The market capitalization of the company must be over a 100 crores</p>
                                    <p>  • The company must have shown a minimum of 10% year-on-year profit growth</p>
                                    <p> • It must be a business with a high ROCE (Return of Capital Employed) of at least
                                    15% in the last 10 years</p>
                                    <p>  • The company must have a strong focus on sustainable competitive advantages and
                                    create a strong brand for itself.</p>
                                    <p>  Key principles of coffee can investing</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">      1. Quality over quantity</p>
                                    <p>    This is the first rule of coffee can investing. Focus on high-quality companies that
                                    have good track records, financials and competitive advantages. You will need to do
                                    extensive research and select the right stocks for your coffee can portfolio.
                                    <p class="text-g">     2. Long-term perspective</p>
                                    <p>   This type of investment is not for people who are looking for quick gains. You will
                                    have to hold on to your stock portfolio for an extended period of time. With this
                                    approach, any short-term market fluctuations will not affect you. Additionally, you
                                    benefit from the power of compounding. You cannot be impulsive. You must have
                                    patience and discipline.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">   3. Minimal trading</p>
                                    <p>   Once you have selected your stocks, you must buy and forget them. This will help you
                                    minimize the short-term noise in the market. It will also minimize transaction
                                    costs.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">   4. Diversification</p>
                                    <p>   The size of your coffee can portfolio need not be very large (It can be about 10 to
                                    15). However, ensure that you spread your investments across different sectors. This
                                    will prevent any concentration risk and capture growth opportunities from various
                                    industries.</p>
                                    Implementing coffee can investing</p>
                                    <p>   To begin implementing your coffee can strategy, follow a few steps:</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">   1. Research and stock selection</p>
                                    Identify companies with a good and consistent record of growth and profitability. Go
                                    over the coffee can investing criteria and ensure that you tick all the boxes.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">  2. Build your portfolio</p>
                                    Once you have identified the potential companies that you want to invest in, build a
                                    diverse portfolio of 10-15 stocks from businesses across various sectors. Choose
                                    from IT services, consumer goods, healthcare and finance.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g"> 3. Invest and hold</p>
                                    Hold on to your chosen stocks for a long period of say 10 years. Resist the need to
                                    make changes to your portfolio based on market dynamics which are very short-term in
                                    nature.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">   4. Regular review</p>
                                    <p>  Although the principle of coffee can investing is to “buy and forget”, you could
                                    review your portfolio annually. This will be required to ensure that the companies
                                    continue to meet your criteria. Do not make frequent changes and trade stocks unless
                                    there is a fundamental shift the prospects of the company.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">   5. Reinvest dividends</p>
                                    <p>  When you chosen stocks pay dividends, just reinvest them. This will help you with
                                    the power of compounding over time.</p>
                                    Challenges of coffee can investing</p>
                                    <p>   Before you begin with your coffee can investment strategy, it is important to be
                                    aware of the challenges in the method:</p>
                                    <p>   • Difficulty in stock selection: The key to identify the right stocks for coffee can
                                    investing. This requires a lot of research and analysis. An individual investor will
                                    find it challenging to find a company that ticks all the criteria.</p>
                                    <p>  • Lack of flexibility: Since the strategy is to “buy and hold”, there are many
