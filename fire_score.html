                                        Every individual has a dream of being able to have a good, well-funded
                                        retirement. If you can do that early, what can be better than that? Many people
                                        who want to retire early follow a financial movement that is defined by
                                        frugality, extreme savings and investment is called “Financial Independence,
                                        Retire Early (FIRE)”. The FIRE movement encourages people to stop working at a
                                        younger age. The concept is that once you achieve financial freedom, you can
                                        take only work that you really want to do.

                                    <p>FIRE is a movement that certain people follow. It champions extreme savings and
                                        investment with the goal of retiring early. People that follow this movement
                                        believe that they must live frugally and have a very high saving rate. Hence,
                                        they plan expenses carefully and invest their savings wisely. </p>
                                    <p>How does the FIRE strategy work? It is broken up into three important steps:</p>
                                    <p>1. You must work on saving about 50-70% of your income</p>
                                    <p>2. Live very frugally</p>
                                    <p>3. Invest wisely</p>
                                    <p>The idea is to consume less and live very simply. A lot of advise and support is
                                        available online for FIRE followers in the form of blog posts, podcasts and
                                        social media.</p>

                                    <p class="text-g ">How did the FIRE movement start?</p>
                                    <p>While the exact origins of the term and the acronym FIRE remains unknown, the movement began in the US. The term FIRE became the core premise of a book that popularised it in 1992: “Your Money or Your Life” by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez. The book popularized many concepts related to the FIRE movement. Although the concept was well known, the movement really took off internationally in 2010 when Jacob Lund Fisker’s “Early Retirement Extreme” came out. After that the FIRE ideals and ideas have spread far and wide and become a lifestyle choice for millennials in the US and UK. Millennials are even resorting to FIRE dating sites so that they can find a partner who can share their dreams of extreme saving and retiring early!</p>

                                    <p class="text-g">How to implement the FIRE strategy and calculate FIRE Score?</p>
                                    <p>The first step in retirement planning is to understand how much money you need to accumulate before you retire. For that, the question that you need to ask yourself is: How much income do I need for early retirement based on my lifestyle? To answer this, people following the FIRE movement use the Rule of 25. This means that your retirement corpus should be at least 25 times of your first-year expenses post-retirement.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>So, if your first-year expenses post-retirement are Rs 12 lakh or Rs 1 lakh a month, then your retirement corpus should be 25 times that amount or Rs 3 crore.</p>
                                    <p>The other name for this rule is the 4% rule. It is just another way to look at the Rule of 25.</p>
                                    <p>If you have accumulated Rs 3 crore and can withdraw only 4% from it, you will get Rs 12 lakh in the first year. </p>
                                    <p>FIRE proponents call this their FIRE number or FIRE Score and start by calculating it. So an ideal FIRE follower will withdraw only 3% to 4% of their savings annually to cover living expenses in retirement. However, this score can change depending on factors like your expected retirement age, life expectancy and investment returns.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">Rule of 25</p>
                                    <p>The rule of 25 says you need to save 25 times your annual expenses to retire. To get this number, first multiply your monthly expenses by 12 to figure out your annual expenses. You then multiply that annual expense by 25 to get your FIRE score or the amount you need to retire.</p>
                                    <p>So, for example, if your monthly expenses are INR 6,000, you multiply that by 12 to get an annual expense of INR 72,000. Multiply that by 25 and you’ll have your FIRE number of INR 1.8 million.</p>
                                    <p>If a FIRE number seems too ambitious, some people explore ways to increase their income and then invest that extra money. </p>
                                    <p>The 4% rule</p>
                                    <p>The 4% rule says that retirees can withdraw 4% of their savings the first year and then adjust for inflation in future years. The 4% rule also assumes a 30-year </p>
                                    <p class="text-g">The bottom line</p>
                                    <p>FIRE is an alternate approach to traditional retirement planning. It helps you retire at an early age. If you want to pursue FIRE, you need to plan carefully. It requires you to be very disciplined and make massive changes to your lifestyle. No one knows what will happen in the future but FIRE strategies will amply reward you in the future. Of course there are challenges like inflation and the probability that investments do not perform as well as we imagine them to. It may sound appealing but there are risks involved. The FIRE approach may not be for everyone.</p>
