                                    Before we understand these terms and the key differences between them, we need to
                                    define what an investment is. Regulating one’s cashflow to get fruitful returns in
                                    the future is known as investment. Choosing an investment method that aligns with
                                    your financial goal is an art.</p>
                                <p>Once you have your financial goal outlined clearly, and have planned your financial
                                    transactions well, you need to choose a systematic financial approach to achieve
                                    your goal.</p>
                                <p> Mutual funds are a popular investment option. Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and
                                    Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) are two commonly used terms in mutual funds. In an
                                    SIP, investors invest a fixed sum of money regularly into mutual fund schemes. While
                                    an SWP allows investors to withdraw a fixed sum of money at regular intervals from
                                    their investments. The two acronyms are complete opposites of each other.
                                    Understanding the SIP Vs SWP debate is important for any investor. While in SIP, an
                                    investor can benefit from rupee cost averaging, SWPs are ideal for generating
                                    income.</p>
                                <p class="text-g"> What is Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)?</p>
                                <p> It is a strategic approach to investment in a mutual fund where you invest a fixed
                                    amount of money into a scheme of your choice at regular intervals. You can choose an
                                    interval based on your comfort like daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly. An SIP is
                                    not only affordable but offers advantages like compounding interest, rupee cost
                                    averaging, and flexibility. It also instils a habit of disciplined saving and
                                    investing in a person.</p>
                                <p> SIPs work on a simple principle that you invest in mutual funds with a small and
                                    regular contribution and build a corpus over time. An SIP can be started with a
                                    nominal sum of INR 500! Therefore, SIPs gain benefits of market-linked returns with
                                    regular and manageable contributions instead of hefty lump sum deposits that are not
                                    feasible for everyone. SIPs are perfect for long-term wealth creation but can also
                                    be used to meet short-term goals.</p>
                                <p> Every mutual fund scheme has a Net Asset Value (NAV): it is basically the price of
                                    one of its units. The NAV is updated daily based on the performance of the mutual
                                    fund in the market. Every time you make a contribution to the mutual fund, you are
                                    buying units at that day’s unit price.</p>
                                <p> The benefit on an SIP is their flexibility. You can easily change the contribution
                                    amount or adjust the frequency of your investments depending on your situation or
                                    financial goal. In case you face a financial emergency, an SIP even offers the
                                    option to temporarily pause your contributions without cancelling the plan.</p>
                                <p class="text-g">What is a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP)?</p>
                                <p> An SWP is the exact opposite of an SIP. As already explained, in a SIP, you are
                                    putting a fixed amount regularly into a mutual fund of your choice. On the other
                                    hand, in a SWP, you are withdrawing a fixed amount regularly from your mutual fund
                                    investment. This means that you are redeeming the units of your mutual fund at the
                                    prevailing Net Asset Value (NAV).</p>
                                <p> So, in a SWP, the amount you receive or withdraw, is dependent on the current NAV on
                                    the day of withdrawal. With each withdrawal, the number of units in your mutual fund
                                    goes down till it reaches zero. Till that happens, the remaining balance will
                                    continue to grow and generate funds based on the market performance of the fund.
                                    SWPs are ideal for individuals who have amassed a large corpus of funds and are
                                    looking to receive a steady stream of income. This type of investment is preferred
                                    by retirees as the SWP allows them to meet their financial needs without liquidating
                                    their entire investment at once. Just as an SIP allows you to decide how much you
                                    want to invest and how often (weekly, quarterly or monthly), an SWP allows you to
                                    decide how much you want to withdraw and how frequently.</p>
                                <p class="text-g">Key difference between SIP and SWP</p>
                                <p> Understanding the differences between SIP and SWP is crucial for investors who are
                                    beginning and stepping into the mutual fund arena for the first time. The primary
                                    difference between the two is that SIP focuses on wealth accumulation while SWP
                                    focuses on income generation from existing investments.
                                    Now let us look at the differences in detail.</p>
                                <p class="text-g">1. Benefits</p>
                                <p> SIPs require regular contributions. This cultivates a regular saving and investment
                                    habit in a person. SIP investments are spread over a long period of time and
                                    therefore minimise the impact of market volatility. This means that you make your
                                    investments irrespective of the market behaviour. Additionally, you enjoy the cost
                                    of rupee cost averaging. This means that you purchase more MF units when the market
                                    is down and fewer units when the market is up. This lowers the average cost of each
                                    unit. SIP is a great tool for building long-term wealth.</p>
                                <p> In a SWP on the other hand, you have an investment that can be redeemed at regular
                                    intervals and gives you a regular source of income. You can customize the amount to
                                    be withdrawn as well as the frequency of withdrawals depending on your requirements.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-g">2. Suitability</p>
                                <p> The suitability of either SIP or SWP depends on what the investor wants. An SIP is
                                    suitable for those seeking long-term wealth creation through regular, manageable
                                    contributions. An SIP investor is willing to save and invest regularly in a
                                    market-linked product. Essentially, an SIP is suitable for a small investor who
                                    finds it difficult to invest lump sum amounts in one go.</p>
                                <p> SWPs on the other hand are tailored for investors who seek a steady and reliable
                                    source of income. Investors who have a lump sum of money like a retiree for example,
                                    can invest in a SWP and ensure a steady income flow to cover monthly obligations and
                                    expenses.</p>
                                <p class="text-g">3. How does it work?</p>
                                <p> The operations of SIPs are relatively simple. An investor contributes a fixed sum at
                                    regular intervals regardless of market conditions. This contribution is used to but
                                    mutual fund units. The number of units purchased will depend of the NAV of the
                                    mutual fund units. When the market is low, more units are purchased and when the
                                    market is high, fewer units are purchased.</p>
                                <p> In a SWP on the other hand, the investor puts in a large corpus into a mutual fund
                                    scheme. Based on their instructions, the fund house redeems a certain amount of
                                    money at regular intervals. In order to meet your requirement, the fund house sells
                                    the mutual fund units from your portfolio at the prevailing NAV.</p>
                                <p class="text-g">4. Tax implication</p>
                                <p> SIPs are investment avenues and therefore do not attract taxes. However, when you
                                    redeem you SIP investment, taxes will be applicable. Certain mutual funds offer a
                                    tax deduction on their SIP investments. Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) are
                                <p class="text-g">tax-saving equity mutual funds.</p>
                                <p> SWPs on the other hand are strictly for withdrawals and hence attract taxes. There
                                    is no Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) in a SWP but a capital gains tax is applicable
                                    based on the scheme and holding period of the funds.</p>
                                <p> In a nutshell, the key differences are:</p>
                                <p> • An SIP allows you to systematically grow your investment, while an SWP is about
                                    systematically withdrawing from funds that you have already invested.</p>
                                <p> • In a SIP, you are regularly investing a fixed amount to grow your money over a
                                    period of time, while a SWP is ideal for income generation.</p>
                                <p class="text-g">Conclusion</p>
                                <p>Both SIP and SWP are strategic and systematic methods by which you can easily invest
                                    and withdraw from mutual funds. Both have their own benefits for investors. SIPs and
                                    SWPs have different purposes and objectives. Therefore, you must choose one based on
                                    your requirements. SIPs are designed to help investors achieve their financial goals
                                    and build long-term wealth. SWPs are focused on generating a stable and consistent
                                    income stream for investors. You must choose between them based on your financial
                                    goals, investment objectives and cash flow needs.
