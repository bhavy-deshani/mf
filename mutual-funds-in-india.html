                                    Mutual funds are a very common investment option these days. A mutual fund gives
                                    individual investors access to diversified, professionally managed portfolios.</p>
                                    What is a mutual fund?</p>
                                    <p>   A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to
                                    purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds or other securities. A mutual fund
                                    is known by the kind of securities that they invest in, their investment objectives
                                    and the type of returns that they seek. A fund manager is responsible and keeps an
                                    eye out and manages these pooled investments. Through mutual funds, individual
                                    investors get exposure to portfolios that are managed by experts.</p>
                                    Types of mutual Funds</p>
                                    There is a diverse range of mutual funds available that are tailored to suit
                                    specific investment goals. Mutual funds are classified based on:</p>
                                  <p>  • Organization structure</p>
                                  <p>  • Asset classes</p>
                                  <p>  • Investment objectives</p>
                                  <p>  • Portfolio management</p>
                                  <p>  • Speciality</p>
                                  <p>  • Risk appetite</p>
                                  <p>  Let us look at them in detail.</p>
                                  <p class="text-g">   Mutual funds based on organizational structure</p>
                                    <p>   1. Close-ended schemes: These funds come with a fixed maturity period. The units of
                                    these schemes are issued by fund houses only at the time of their New Fund Offer
                                    (NFO). After the NFO period, these schemes are listed on the stock exchanges. An
                                    investor wanting to leave these schemes before the maturity period, can trade their
                                    units on the stock exchange. After maturity, the schemes are dissolved and the
                                    investors receive the money back the Net Asset Value (NAV). The NAV represents the
                                    market value per share of any mutual fund. Close-ended mutual funds are ideal for
                                    those who are looking for a long-term investment. In other words, people who have a
                                    hefty sum and are seeking an avenue to park the funds for an extended period of time
                                    will benefit from these types of mutual funds.</p>
                                    <p>    2. Open-ended schemes: Unlike close-ended schemes, investors can buy and sell units
                                    of these schemes even after the NFO. This is an ideal option for investors who want
                                    to buy and sell the units at their convenience. Investors can sell the units at the
                                    NAV of the day. This offers a higher level of liquidity to investors who want to
                                    enter and exit these plans and are willing to take a moderate or high risk.
                                    <p>  3. Interval schemes: These are a hybrid option of both the above types that we have
                                    discussed. The units of these schemes can be bought and sold only during specific
                                    transaction periods called intervals. As is done in close-ended schemes, the units
                                    of the interval schemes are listed on stock exchanges. Investors who are seeking
                                    exposure to unconventional assets like commercial property or forestry tracts can
                                    benefit from these type of funds.</p>

                                    <p class="text-g">   Mutual fund schemes based on asset classes</p>

                                    <p>   • Equity funds: These funds invest the assets in the shares of companies. An equity
                                    fund scheme invests at least 65% of their assets in equities and related
                                    investments. The balance funds are invested in more secure assets to offset any risk
                                    involved. The performance of the shares dictate the returns from these funds.
                                    Furthermore, equity funds can be categorized in many ways. For instance, they can be
                                    based on the way they are managed: as active or passive funds. Sometimes people
                                    categorize them based on the market capitalization of the stocks that they invest
                                    in: so either small, mid, multi or large cap funds. They can also be categorized on
                                    the geography that they invest in (domestic and foreign funds) or the sector in
                                    which they invest in (pharma, FMCG, real estate). Equity funds have a track record
                                    of good returns when compared with other mutual funds and are suitable for building
                                    wealth.</p>
                                    <p>  • Debt funds: These funds invest their wealth in fixed-income instruments like
                                    corporate or government bonds or treasury bills. Debt funds are less risky when
                                    compared to equity funds. They offer better returns even when compared to
                                    traditional options like fixed deposits. If you are seeking a regular income, this
                                    is a good option.</p>
                                    <p>   • Hybrid funds: Hybrid funds consist of both debt and equity components. Those with
                                    a moderate risk appetite can go for this option. Hybrid funds are classified based
                                    on how they invest their funds. They can be classified as conservative (invest 75%
                                    of asset in debt and the rest in equity), aggressive (invest 65-80% in equity and
                                    the rest in debt instruments), dynamic asset allocation funds (invest in both debt
                                    and equity based on market conditions), multi asset allocation (invest at least 10%
                                    of the money in three asset classes based on market conditions), arbitrage funds
                                    (invest 65% of asset in equity and balance in debt) and lastly equity savings funds
                                    (invest at least 65% of the asset in equity and 10% in debt instruments).</p>
                                    <p>   • Money market funds: These funds normally invest in low-risk, short term securities
                                    such as treasury bills, certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Since they
                                    offer high liquidity, investors use them as an effective short-term cash management
                                    tool.</p>

                                    <p class="text-g">   Mutual fund schemes based on portfolio management</p>

                                    • Active funds: The portfolio is actively managed by the fund managers who decide
                                    <p>   which securities to buy and sell. These funds achieve higher returns through active
                                    management strategies and are designed to outperform a benchmark index.</p>
                                    <p>  • Passive funds: These are designed to replicate the performance of a particular
                                    market index. They match the returns of the index that they track. Since they do not
                                    involve active stock selection or market timing strategies, they are termed
                                    “passive”.</p>

                                    <p class="text-g">   Mutual fund schemes based on investment objective</p>

                                    <p>  • Growth funds: These funds invest in stocks of companies that expect to register
                                    above-average growth rate compared to their industry peers. These mutual funds
                                    provide high returns and also carry a higher risk.</p>
                                    <p>   • Income funds: These funds provide a steady income stream through interest payments
                                    or dividends. These funds invest in assets that generate income like bonds, stocks
                                    that pay dividends, and other fixed-income securities. These funds are suitable for
                                    people who are retiring or those looking to supplement their income.</p>
                                    <p>  • Liquid funds: These funds invest in short-term debt instruments with low risk and
                                    high liquidity. These funds provide a safe and liquid investment option with an
                                    option to convert the funds into cash without too much losses.</p>

                                    <p class="text-g">    Mutual fund schemes based on investment objective</p>

                                    <p>  • Low-risk funds: These funds invest in debt instruments and offer stable returns
                                    rather than aggressive growth.</p>
                                    <p>   • Medium-risk funds: They invest in a diversified portfolio of assets and have a
                                    moderate level of risk. They invest in a mix of stocks, bond and financial
                                    instruments. They are a good balance between good returns and risk exposure.</p>
                                    <p>   • High-risk funds: These funds have high-risk assets such as stocks, commodities,
                                    futures or emerging markets. They generate high returns and are ideal for wealth
                                    creation.</p>

                                    Mutual fund schemes based on investment objective</p>
                                    <p>   These funds focus on specific industries, themes or sectors. They aim to capitalise
                                    on the growth of a particular sector by investing in companies in that domain.

                                    <p>   • Sector funds: These funds invest in a particular industry. The performance of
                                    these sectors will dictate the returns from these funds. Examples are technology or
                                    real estate funds.</p>
                                    <p>   • Index funds: They invest in a diversifies portfolio of stocks that comprise the

                                    <p>   Mutual funds are ideal for wealth creation. Various mutual funds are available and
                                    can cater to every need of an investor. It is important to analyse the performance
                                    of a mutual fund and choose one that suits your requirement, financial goals and
                                    risk appetite. It is important to read the policy document carefully to know where
                                    the funds are invested and understand the terms and conditions of the mutual fund.
