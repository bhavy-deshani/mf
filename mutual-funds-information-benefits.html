                                <p>You can think of mutual funds as a basket of investments. Each basket holds dozens of
                                    security types, such as stocks or bonds. Therefore, when you buy a mutual fund, you
                                    are buying a basket of investment securities, where the income is earned from
                                    dividends and interests.</p>

                                    <span>Safety & Transparency</span>
                                    <p>Mutual fund is regulated by SEBI, you can be assured that your investments are
                                        managed in a disciplined and regulated manner.</p>
                                    <span>Higher Return Potential</span>
                                    <p>Based on medium or long-term investment, mutual funds have the potential to
                                        generate a higher return, as you can invest on a diverse range of sectors and
                                        industries.</p>
                                    <span>Liquidity</span>
                                    <p>Investors have the advantage of getting their money back promptly; it can also be
                                        traded in the stock exchange, as offered by some schemes. A mutual fund can be
                                        converted into cash at any time as per your request.</p>
                                    <span>Low Cost</span>
                                    <p>Mutual funds are less expensive. One can start with as low as Rs.500 and get the
                                        advantage of long term equity investment. Because a mutual fund buys and sells
                                        large amounts of securities at a time, its transaction costs are lower.</p>
                                    <span>Diversification</span>
                                    <p>It helps you distribute your investment across a diverse range of assets. Mutual
                                        funds are a great investment opportunity for investors who have limited
                                        investment capital. The idea behind diversification is to invest in a large
                                        number of assets so that a loss in any particular investment is minimized by
                                        gains in others. Large mutual funds typically own hundreds of different stocks
                                        in many different industries. It wouldn't be possible for an investor to build
                                        this kind of a portfolio with a small amount of money.</p>

                                    <span>How to invest in mutual funds</span>
                                    <p>You can invest in a mutual fund either via their online/mobile platform or in
                                        physical form, through an independent financial adviser (IFA), through your bank
                                        who can suggest a balanced portfolio suitable for your risk appetite. You will
                                        only require a few documents such as a photograph, PAN card, name and address
                                        proof, bank account details and KYC compliance. You can right away open a mutual
                                        fund or a demat account and start your chosen mutual fund scheme. Today,
                                        monitoring such mutual funds is extremely easy, through online market checks or
                                        through a financial advisor or through the corresponding mutual funds agent.</p>

                                    <p class="text-g">SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)</p>
                                    <span>Time in the market is more important than timing the market</span>
                                    <p>What is a Systematic Investment Plan? A Systematic Investment Plan or SIP is a
                                        smart and hassle-free mode for investing money in mutual funds. SIP allows you
                                        to invest a certain pre­ determined amount at a regular interval (weekly,
                                        monthly, quarterly, etc.) A SIP is a planned approach towards investments and
                                        helps you inculcate the habit of saving and building wealth for the future.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="lh-lg">
                                    <p class="text-g">Benefits of SIP</p>
                                    <p>Disciplined Saving - Discipline is the key to successful investments. When you
                                        invest through SIP, you commit yourself to save regularly. Every investment is a
                                        step towards attaining your financial objectives.</p>
                                    <p>Flexibility - It is good to continue SIP investments with a long-term
                                        perspective. Investors can discontinue the plan at any time. One can also
                                        increase or decrease the amount being invested.</p>
                                    <p>Long-Term Gains - Due to rupee-cost averaging (trying to buy low and sell high),
                                        SIPs have the potential to deliver attractive returns over a longer investment
                                        period.</p>
                                    <p>Convenience - SIP is an easy method of investment. You can issue a standing
                                        instruction to your bank to facilitate auto-debits from your bank account.</p>
