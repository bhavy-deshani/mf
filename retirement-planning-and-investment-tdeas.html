                                        Every human being irrespective of their background, aspires to have a secure
                                        retirement. It is important to start planning for your retirement at the right
                                        time and ensure that funds are available when you stop working. Remaining
                                        financially independent in your old age can give a sense of comfort and mental
                                        peace to a human being.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Retirement planning can begin at any time during your working years; however, it
                                        is better if you begin earlier. You must determine your long-term financial
                                        goals and start taking actions that will help you reach that goal. To begin
                                        with, you will need to identify your sources of income, have a good idea of your
                                        expenditure, put in place a savings plan and manage your assets. A retirement
                                        plan will need to be updated every now and then based on reality.</p>

                                    <p>A retirement plan is a roadmap to a comfortable life after you retire. This means
                                        that you must have enough money to pay and support your lifestyle in your old
                                        age. When planning for your retirement, you must take into account your
                                        lifestyle, anticipated retirement age and medical expenses into account. You
                                        must also plan for emergency funds. These funds will act as a safety net to
                                        cover unexpected expenses like medical bills, appliance repairs or home
                                        emergencies. Emergency funds can ensure peace of mind in unforeseen
                                        circumstances. </p>
                                    <p>You also need to account for inflation affecting your retirement funds. You must
                                        estimate at least a 6-8% inflation and adjust your retirement corpus. This will
                                        ensure its purchasing power maintains pace with the rising prices.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="text-g">How much do you need to retire?</p>
                                    <p>There are several variables that contribute to calculating your retirement funds.
                                        A popular rule of thumb that is used is the “30x rule”. This rule states that
                                        you should have 30 times your yearly income in yearly savings. This is just a
                                        general rule and a lot can depend on your lifestyle, your lifespan and the rate
                                        of inflation. Retirement planning is a continuous effort. The first thing to do
                                        is to assess your yearly spending and determine your retirement corpus. Then
                                        take help from a financial advisor to account for inflation and specific
                                        situations that you may encounter. There are no guarantees that your retirement
                                        funds will be sufficient but you must regularly assess your funds and make
                                        necessary adjustments to your plan. </p>

                                    <p class="text-g">Tips for retirement planning</p>
                                    <p>To begin with your retirement planning, follow the following steps:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>1.	Start saving now: Beginning early will give you a head start. When you start early, you have more time to save a corpus that will grow steadily every year. When you stay invested for a long time, the power of compounding works better for you. Purchasing a pension plan in your 20s or 30s will ensure you a financially secure retired life. </p>
                                    <p>2.	Prepare for future financial emergencies: Financial emergencies can arise anytime. It is important to estimate and plan for them. For instance, a medical insurance plan can be a contingency fund to help with medical costs and emergencies when you retire.</p>
                                    <p>3.	Life insurance: A life insurance policy is an excellent traditional financial plan. You could consider a long-term plan that secures the financial future of your family and prepare for a good retired life. There are various plans available that can mature at different times and be a great support to you and your loved ones. </p>
                                    <p>4.	Diversify your investments: It is important to not put all your eggs in one basket. Especially so while doing financial planning. It is important to diversify investments to ensure good returns in the future. Look for investment options that have a lower risk allowing you to invest in different types of funds. You must pick an investment option that suits your financial goals and appetite for risk. </p>
                                    <p>5.	Define your retirement goals: Before purchasing a retirement plan, understand what your retirement goal is. Estimate future costs based on your lifestyle, estimated upswing in travel and other costs. If you are clear about your future goals, it is easy to plan better for them. For instance, if you want to travel or do something meaningful like learn to play an instrument, you need to budget for it. Based on your needs, work on a plan that will help you meet your target.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">Eligibility criteria for retirement plans</p>
                                    <p>•	Entry age: To begin enrolling in a retirement plan, you need to be at least 18 years old. When you start so early in life, you can benefit from the power of compounding. Some plans have a higher entry age limit. Check the specific plan that you are considering investing in for details.</p>
                                    <p>•	Premiums: Your regular contribution to your retirement plan is known as the premium. Premiums are decided based on your affordability and the desired income you want post-retirement. Certain plans offer a flexible premium option so that you can adjust your contribution as your financial situation evolves.</p>
                                    <p>•	Vesting age: This means the age at which you begin to receive the retirement benefits that have accumulated in your plan. Every plan specifies a different age and it can vary. Typically, it is between 40 and 80 years of age.</p>
                                    <p class="text-g">Retirement options in India</p>
                                    <p>There are various options available for retirement planning in India that you can choose from. Some investment options for retirement planning include:</p>

                                    <p class="text-g">Why plan for retirement?</p>
                                    <p>Advancements in healthcare have increased life expectancy. This means that people have to plan their finances better expecting to live longer. Your ideal retirement plan must ensure that the retirement savings last throughout the retirement years. </p>
                                    <p>Added to this is the inflation which refers to the rate at which the prices of goods and services increase over time. This decreases the purchasing power of your money. Planning for the impact of inflation is very important in retirement planning. Cost of living will double in 14 years. So if you plan to retire in 20 years, you need more than double what you require now to maintain your standard of living. </p>
                                    <p>A well-planned retirement plan will help you accumulate wealth that you can use once you retire and pass on to your loved ones. With guaranteed returns, you can build a significant corpus over time. This will help you leave a legacy for your family and maintain a standard of living. These funds will also help you become emergency-ready. Unexpected events can disrupt financial security. Retirement funds can provide a buffer during challenging times. </p>
                                    <p class="text-g">Conclusion</p>
                                    <p>Old age is a time when people want to be stress-free and not be financially dependent on anyone including their children. Hence retirement planning must be a top priority when you are earning. Learning about and understanding the right investment opportunities is essential at a young age. Your comfort in your old age will depend on how well planned you are when you are young. Saving well and managing your risk is extremely important for retirement planning.</p>
